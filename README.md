 # Features Of BikeHunter

 1) Filtering Options: A responsive bike selection website should offer comprehensive filtering options to allow users to narrow down their search based on their preferences. Filters may include criteria such as bike type (mountain, road, hybrid), frame size, wheel size, brand, price range, and more. This enables users to quickly find bikes that meet their specific requirements.
2) User Reviews and Ratings: Integrating user-generated reviews and ratings for each bike allows potential buyers to gain insights from the experiences of others. Displaying authentic feedback helps build trust and confidence in the product, assisting users in making informed decisions. Implementing sorting options based on ratings or helpfulness of reviews can further enhance usability.
3) Comparative Tools: Providing tools for users to compare multiple bikes side by side allows them to make informed decisions. This feature should highlight key specifications and attributes of each bike, such as frame material, gear systems, suspension type, and weight, facilitating a comprehensive comparison to assist users in selecting the most suitable option.

# Problems I Faced
Developing a responsive site that loads quickly and performs well on various devices and network conditions is another challenge. Balancing visual aesthetics with optimized performance requires careful consideration of factors such as image optimization, minification of CSS and JavaScript files, lazy loading techniques, and leveraging caching mechanisms. Achieving optimal performance on both high-end desktops and low-powered mobile devices can be particularly challenging.
